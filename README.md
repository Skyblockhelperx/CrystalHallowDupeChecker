# CrystalHallowDupeChecker
Checks items in inventories to see if they were duped as part of the Crystal Hollows Dupe Event in Hypixel Skyblock.  Highlights them in red in your inventory, and adds a lore line "POSSIBLY DUPED".  Uses the originTag ITEM_STASH property to check whether they're duped as part of the Jan 2022 Crystal Hollows dupe.
